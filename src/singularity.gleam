//// Singularity is a registry for shared singleton actors, in Gleam.
////
//// When an actor's process exits, it will be removed from the registry
//// automatically.  Fetching an actor using the [require](#require) function
//// will block until that actor has been registered.  These two properties
//// allow OTP supervisors to start your actors only when their dependencies
//// are ready.
////
//// ### Example Usage
////
//// ```
//// import actor_a
//// import actor_b
////
//// // Define a wrapper type for the actors (Subjects) you want register.
//// type Actors {
////   ActorA(Subject(actor_a.Message))
////   ActorB(Subject(actor_b.Message))
//// }
////
//// pub fn main() {
////   let assert Ok(registry) = singularity.start()
////   let assert Ok(actor_a_subj) = actor_a.start()
////   let assert Ok(actor_b_subj) = actor_b.start()
////
////   // Register the actors specifying your wrapper (`Actors`) variant.
////   singularity.register(registry, ActorA, actor_a_subj)
////   singularity.register(registry, ActorB, actor_b_subj)
////
////   // Retrieve registered actors, each will be returned via your
////   // wrapper type.
////   let assert ActorA(got_a) =
////     singularity.require(registry, ActorA, timeout_ms: 1000)
////   let assert ActorB(got_b) =
////     singularity.require(registry, ActorB, timeout_ms: 1000)
//// }
//// ```
////
